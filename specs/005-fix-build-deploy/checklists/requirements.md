# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Build & Deploy Pipeline

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec references "GitHub Actions", "VitePress", "Flutter", and "Widgetbook" by name — these are acceptable because they are the specific products involved in the problem (not implementation choices to be made). The spec describes *what* must work, not *how* to implement it.
- FR-008 references "registry corruption" which is a diagnosed root cause needed to understand the problem scope. This is domain context, not implementation detail.
- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
